**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python: Utilized for data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis.
- Libraries:
  - Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for data visualization.
  - NumPy: Used for numerical computations.
  - Plotly Express: Utilized for interactive visualizations.
- Tableau: Employed for creating an interactive dashboard for comprehensive data exploration.

**Approach:**
1. Data Exploration: Comprehensive exploration of the dataset's structure and contents to understand variables and potential insights.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Tasks included handling missing values, irrelevant columns, and data type inconsistencies, ensuring data readiness for analysis.
3. Visualization and Analysis: Creation of various visualizations to uncover crime trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
4. Dashboard Creation: Utilized Tableau to design an interactive dashboard, facilitating in-depth exploration of the data. The dashboard features three parameters for comparing different years and one parameter for viewing data by specific crime type. Additionally, it displays the percent change in different attributes, offering comprehensive insights into crime dynamics.

**Challenges and Learning Opportunities:**
- Challenges: In addition to navigating Tableau, another challenge encountered was integrating real-time data feeds for more dynamic analysis.
- Learning Opportunities: Despite challenges, the project provided valuable learning experiences, particularly in mastering Tableau functionalities and exploring real-time data integration.

**Key Insights:**
- Insights derived from analyzing crime data encompassed trends in reported crimes versus arrests, temporal patterns in crime occurrence, and shifts in crime distribution across different locations.

**Dashboard Features:**
- The dashboard offers three parameters for comparing different years and one parameter for viewing data by specific crime type.
- It also displays the percent change in different attributes, providing comprehensive insights into crime dynamics.


**How to Read the Dashboard:**
- The dashboard allows users to select different years and crime types for comparison using the parameters provided.
- Users can analyze percent changes from previous year to current year to gain insights into crime trends and patterns over time.
- Interactive elements enable users to explore specific data points and drill down into detailed information as needed.
